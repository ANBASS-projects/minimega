Building a new VM

* Introduction

Before you can use minimega, you must build disk images or RAM disks for your
VMs. The minimega distribution includes `vmbetter`, which can build several
minimal RAM disks (see
[[tutorials/vmbetter.article][the vmbetter tutorial for more information]]).
These work well for generic experiments but sometimes, you need more than a
minimal install. This article describes the process to build a VM disk from an
install CD.

* Install CD

First, you must obtain an install CD as an ISO image. This can be downloaded
from the web or provided by a vendor.

* Starting a VM

In order to perform the install, we create a new qcow and launch a VM with it
and the cdrom:

    disk create qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 20G
    vm config disk ubuntu.qcow2
    vm config cdrom ubuntu.iso
    vm config snapshot false
    vm launch kvm ubuntu
    vm start all

Importantly, we set `snapshot=false` so that any changes we make to the disk
persist. Without this flag, all the changes would disappear when we killed the
VM.

** Network-based install

Some installers make use the Internet to pull more recent packages or software.
See [[nat.article][this article]] for more information.

* Perform the install

The VM should now be running and the installer will be waiting for user input.
Start `miniweb` and click through the installer using the web interface.

* Post-install configuration

Once the VM is installed, you may make additional changes to the filesystem in
order to make persistent changes. This could mean installing additional
software or configurations.

** Adding miniccc to VMs

Typically, we add `miniccc` to our VM images to facilitate experiment control.
First, we must load the binary onto the VM. This can be done in a number of
different ways including over the network (if the VM is launched with an
interface) or via the `hotplug` API.

Once `miniccc` is on the VM, we must configure it to start automatically.

*** init Scripts (Linux)

There are several examples of integrating miniccc into vmbetter-built VMs in
the repo (see `misc/vmbetter_configs/`).

*** systemd Integration (Linux)

To start miniccc automatically with systemd, add the following to
`/etc/systemd/system/miniccc.service`:

    [Unit]
    Description=miniccc

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/miniccc -v=false -serial /dev/virtio-ports/cc -logfile /var/log/miniccc.log

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

You may need to adjust the ExecStart command if you copied miniccc elsewhere.
And then enable the service:

    systemctl enable miniccc.service

This will start miniccc whenever the VM starts. If you are adding to a VM with
snapshot=false, you should now shutdown the VM and save the disk image.

*** Task Scheduler (Windows)

The built-in Task Scheduler on Windows can be configured to run `miniccc.exe`
on startup.

* Final steps

** Clean up

To make the image smaller, you may wish to remove any cached files (e.g. run
`apt`clean`).

** Sysprep (Windows)

Before finalizing a Windows VM, it is a good idea to use Sysprep to generalize
the VM. This removes computer-specific information so that when you launch
multiple VMs from the same image, they each have a different identifier.

** Shutdown

Finally, shutdown the VM from within the VM using the standard shutdown
mechanism. Wait for the VM to fully shutdown to ensure that the filesystem is
in a consistent state. minimega will update the VM state to `quit` when the VM
has fully powered off. You may now call `vm`flush` to remove the VM.

The image should now be ready to use:

    vm config disk ubuntu.qcow2
    vm launch kvm ubuntu[0-3]
    vm start all

Note that further changes can be made by launching the VM with
`snapshot=false`.
