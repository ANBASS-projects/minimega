<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p>Although minimega is primarily controlled through the command line (or through scripts), it also provides a web interface that displays information on running VMs in a convenient format. These screenshots demonstrate some of the web capabilities.</p>

<p>The default view shows a table of running VMs. The user can select which fields should be displayed in the table. Each VM entry has a "Connect" link, which will take the user directly to the console of that particular VM as shown in later screenshots.</p>

<p>Clicking on the "VM Screenshots" tab at the top of the page will display a table of screenshots taken from the currently running VMs. This can be used to get an overview of the state of the experiment, or to visually choose a VM to connect to.</p>

<p>Virtual consoles are provided for both QEMU/KVM and container VMs. KVM VMs use an HTML5-based VNC client to connect to the KVM process:</p>

<p>Container VMs provide a Javascript text-only terminal:</p>

<p>The "Graph" tab provides a clickable visualization of the experiment's network and VM layout.</p>
