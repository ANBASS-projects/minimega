		minimega is a tool to rapidly create networks of virtual machines. It was originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories to facilitate internet scale emulytics by providing a mechanism to launch hundreds of thousands of virtual machines in arbitrary network topologies.
minimega is designed to run on large clusters without the need for configuration. When run on multiple machines, minimega provides a simple interface, resiliency, autodiscovery, and multi-tenancy. minimega can also be run as a standalone tool on a single workstation, and is simple enough to use everyday for your desktop virtual machines. </p>

		<p>minimega was developed under multiple Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) grants at <a href="http://sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a> for the United States Department of Energy.</p>
